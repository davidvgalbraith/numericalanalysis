Numerical Analysis routines

naivegauss.m implements naive Gaussian elimination to solve a system of linear equations. 

lufactorize.m implements LU factorization, turning a matrix A into the product of matrices LU where L is lower-triangular with ones on the diagonal and U is upper-triangular.

cubic.m: Find the roots of a third-degree polynomial.

quadrature.m: Integrate a given function between two endpoints, with a specified accuracy.
